# Lab - Operators

## Setup
Download and unzip the starter code Operators__Lab_Starter and open it in IntelliJ.

## Lab
1. Look at the `static` method `Exercises.myMethod`.  What does it do?  Write unit tests in the `Exercises_Tests` class (test package) that verify your answer.

2. Implement the rest of the methods in the `Exercises` class so that they:
- conform to the specification given in their comments
- pass their corresponding unit tests
